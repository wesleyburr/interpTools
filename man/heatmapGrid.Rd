\usage{
heatmapGrid(
  agEval,
  f = "median",
  crit,
  m,
  d = 1:length(agEval),
  colors = c("#F9E0AA", "#F7C65B", "#FAAF08", "#FA812F", "#FA4032", "#F92111")
)
}
\arguments{
\item{agEval}{\code{aggregate_pf}; An object containing the aggregated performance metrics (result of \code{aggregate_pf()})}

\item{f}{\code{character}; The statistic of interest that will be depicted by the heatmap. Possible choices are listed in \code{?aggregate_pf}.}

\item{crit}{\code{character}; A single element describing the performance metric of interest}

\item{m}{\code{character}; A single element describing the interpolation methods of interest}

\item{d}{\code{numeric}; A vector to indicate datasets of interest}

\item{colors}{\code{character}; A vector of the desired color palette, with entries in HTML format (\code{"#xxxxxx"})}
}
\description{
A function to generate a set of heatmaps depicting the performances of particular sets of interpolations. This graphic can be considered as a series of 'compressed' surface plots, arranged by dataset.\cr
