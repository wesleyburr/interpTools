\arguments{
\item{agEval}{\code{aggregate_pf}; An object containing the aggregated performance metrics (result of \code{aggregate_pf()})}

\item{cross_section}{\code{character}; An element describing the gap structure variable to represent on the x-axis: either \code{"p"} or \code{"g"}}

\item{d}{\code{numeric}; A vector to indicate datasets of interest}

\item{m}{\code{character}; A vector of interpolation methods of interest}

\item{f}{\code{character}; The statistic of interest defining the ribbon. Possible choices are listed in \code{?aggregate_pf}}

\item{layer_type}{\code{character}; How to layer the ribbons (by "method" or by "dataset")}

\item{highlight}{\code{character/numeric}; A single method (if \code{layer_type = "method"}) or dataset (if \code{layer_type = "dataset"}) to highlight.}

\item{highlight_color}{\code{character}; An HTML color of format \code{"#xxxxxx"} to apply to \code{highlight}}

\description{
Function to generate uncollapsed cross-section plots to visualize changes in the performance metrics of interest
as the \strong{proportion of missing data} and \strong{gap width increase}. Instead of three axes, as in the surface plots, 
either \code{p} or \code{g} can be broken down such that changes in performance are depicted with respect to one variable, 
across each value of the other. The variable to form the x-axis is specified in \code{cross_section}.
Plots are arranged vertically, where each represents performance plotted against each fixed value in the 
variable not specified in \code{cross_section}. The middle line is the \strong{median} value, the upper 
ribbon boundary is the \strong{97.5th quantile} value, and the lower ribbon boundary is the
\strong{2.5th quantile} value.
